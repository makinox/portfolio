    text: 'Three words to describe Jesus: innovative, accountable, and multifaceted. During our time working together, he showed those 3 characteristics, while we were developing a Desktop App, embracing uncertainty and finding solutions for a timely delivery. Thanks to that we managed to launch it successfully to the market, learned to use new technologies, and set the basis for other similar projects. He was also constantly researching and experimenting with new technologies and design tools. I would recommend him to any company that is not afraid of exploring the unknown and challenging the status quo!',
